 <h2>
   Learnings 🤯
   </h2>
   This application for searching Gifs through the API provided by Giphy itself, very well documented and structured.<br>
   Here was my second experience using APIs, and I did well in both, despite the doubts I had about how to consult, I managed to understand the concept, and how to do    it.
   Certainly with a lot of practice I will learn more and more about it.<br>
   I also learned a lot about new widgets, the share plugin, layouts, and logic.
